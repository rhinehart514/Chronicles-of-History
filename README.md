# Chronicles of History

**An AI-powered grand strategy game where every decision writes history.**

Guide nations through 500 years of alternate history. Unlike traditional strategy games, Chronicles uses AI to generate dynamic narratives, unique historical figures, and consequences that ripple across generations.

## Why This Game?

- **AI-Generated Narratives** - No two playthroughs are the same. Gemini AI creates unique events, character personalities, and story arcs based on your decisions
- **Deep Simulation** - Court intrigue, faction politics, espionage, economics, and military systems inspired by Paradox depth
- **Historical What-Ifs** - What if Prussia unified Germany in 1700? What if the American Revolution failed? Your choices create alternate timelines
- **Emergent Storytelling** - Watch your decisions cascade through generations. A trade deal in 1520 might spark a revolution in 1789
